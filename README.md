# led64_gpm : 8x8 LED matrix
(based on Wayne's LPC175X_Template)

This is a 8x8 LED matrix project for Wayne's PCB class.

This is based on Wayne's template for an 80-pin LPC175x Cortex-M3 ARM32 embedded
processor.  The board is 49mm x 49mm and has 4 mounting holes
arranged in a 40mm square.  The mountin holes are 3.0mm (or #4)
diameter.  In addition, the board has the various electronics
needed to connect to a serial downloader, a JTAG debugger dongle,
and Maker Bus.
